# Machine Learning Linear Regression Project

This repository contains the code for a Machine Learning Linear Regression project as part of the internship under The Sparks Foundation's GRIP program.

## Task Description

The objective of this project is to implement and apply Linear Regression to predict percentage scores of students based on their study hours.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Prediction Using Supervised ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the Linear Regression analysis.
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed to run the Jupyter Notebook:

- Python
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
